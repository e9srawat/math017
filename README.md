# Problem No. 17

## Number Letter Counts

If the numbers $1$ to $5$ are written out in words: one, two, three, four, five, then there are $3 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 19$ letters used in total.

**NOTE:** Do not count spaces or hyphens. For example, $342$ (three hundred and forty-two) contains $23$ letters and $115$ (one hundred and fifteen) contains $20$ letters. The use of "and" when writing out numbers is in compliance with British usage.

## Part A

If all the numbers from $1$ to $1000$ (one thousand) inclusive were written out in words, how many letters would be used?

Edit the file answer.py and update the function `answer()` to return the answer.

## Part B

Generalize the solution to count the number of letters in the range `a` to `b` inclusive.

Edit the file `solver.py` and update the function `solver()` with your generalized solution.

```python
solver(a: int = None, b: int = None)
```
